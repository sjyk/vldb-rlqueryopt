\section{Synthesizer}
Given a the list of edits and cells, the synthesizer generates a Python program that given future unlabeled dirty data in the same schema will predict the the label. \sys converts the proposed edits into a lambda without any import dependencies. This allows for the detection predicate to be efficiently evaluated on new data, as well as be serialized so it can on future data without having to be retrained.

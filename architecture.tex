\section{Optimizer Architecture}
We call this new join optimization algorithm \sys, and describe how it fits into a query optimization stack. 

\subsection{API}
\sys optimizes Select-Project-Join (SPJ) blocks of SQL queries. To plug \sys into a query optimizer here are the API hooks that we require implemented:

\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{lstlisting}
sample(): List<Queries> 
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent A function that returns a list of training queries of interest.

\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{lstlisting}
train(query): List<Graph,Join,Graph',Cost> 
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent A function that given a query returns a list of join actions and their resultant costs. 

\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{lstlisting}
selectivity(predicate): Double
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent A function that returns the reduction factor of a particular single table predicate.

\vspace{0.5em}
Given these three functions, \sys can plug in to any system. It takes as input an SPJ block and outputs an optimized logical and physical join plan. 
Our prototype implementation is built on Apache Calcite.
The system connects to various database engines through a JDBC connector and has a internal simulator to model different physical design choices.

\subsection{Architectural Implications}
\textbf{TODO: Joe wanted to write something here}


\subsection{Limitations}
This work is meant to be an initial study of Deep Reinforcement Learning in the context of join optimization. There are a number of features expected of join optimizers that are not yet supported. We plan to add such support in future work but felt it was out of scope of this paper.

 \vspace{0.5em} \noindent \textbf{Sort Orders: } We do not consider cost models for sorting, sort-merge joins, or interesting orders. Keeping track of interesting sort orders in subplans is actually not difficult in our framework. They can be tracked as a set of additional features. 

\vspace{0.5em} \noindent  \textbf{Outer Joins/Inequality Joins: } We currently only consider optimization of inner joins and conjunctions of join conditions.
